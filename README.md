ff-av is a quick script to download fantasy football auction draft values and store them in a CSV file. It's currently configured to do it using the Selenium webdriver and only pulling from Yahoo. Pull requests to make it more flexible are welcome.

To get it working:
- Install the selenium library (pip install -r requirements.txt)
- Download the [Chrome webdriver](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/wiki/ChromeDriver) and place it in your PATH
- Run the script using "python scrape_value.py"
